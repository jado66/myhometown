MHT Block captains, who help identify the projects, are responsible for overseeing the project and assisting in providing the necessary resources. Day of Service is scheduledâ€”typically a Saturday morning.  Multiple projects are scheduled for each Day of Service. These projects are typically home and neighbor clean-up but can be more involved as needs are identified.  Volunteers from nearby neighborhoods participate in the Day of Service. The city often provides dumpsters and heavy equipment, and the homeowner participates in the cost and service as they are able. ",
